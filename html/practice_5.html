                I've been playing the cello since I was 3 or 4. Some pieces I've played include the Bach Cello Suite No.3 Bourrée, Bach Cello Suite No.1 Prelude, Allegro Appassionato by Saint Saëns, and more. In the near future, I would like to learn to play either Haydn Cello Concerto in C Major or Haydn Cello Concerto in D Major.

                I also enjoy playing tennis. I recently tried out for the Punahou JV tennis team but unfortunately, I didn't make it. I did play for Punahou in 8th grade. Currently, I play for the Waialae Iki 5 tennis team. I enjoy playing both singles and doubles, though I have played more doubles matches.
