    About me</h1>
    <p>My name is Lucas and I am in 9th grade. I came to Punahou in 7th grade from California where I was born and raised for 12 years. I also love to play tennis and played for Punahou in 8th grade while I also play for my local team.

       <p> I enjoy playing the cello. I've been playing for around 11 years. I am currently also in the Hawaii Youth Symphony. I was also part of a quartet at Punahou from the last two school years.

       <p id="emphasis">  I also enjoy travelling. I've been to over 30 countries spanning 5 different continents. Some countries I've been to are Morocco, Cambodia, Czechia, and Mongolia.
